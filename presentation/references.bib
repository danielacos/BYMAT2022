	abstract = {The design of numerical approximations of the Cahn-Hilliard model preserving the maximum principle is a challenging problem, even more if considering additional transport terms. In this work, we present a new upwind discontinuous Galerkin scheme for the convective Cahn-Hilliard model with degenerate mobility which preserves the maximum principle and prevents non-physical spurious oscillations. Furthermore, we show some numerical experiments in agreement with the previous theoretical results. Finally, numerical comparisons with other schemes found in the literature are also carried out.},
